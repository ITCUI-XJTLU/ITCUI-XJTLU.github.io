Welcome to my personal website. I am a first year master student in the Department of Biostatistics (thesis track) at the University of Washington, Seattle. Before I joined UW Biostatistics,  I graduated from the Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University with a BS degree in applied mathematics. 
My current research interests include:

* Clinical trials
* Causal Inference
* Statistical Learning
* High dimensional Statistics

In my spare time, I enjoy long distance running, playing basketball, drinking tea and coffee, listening to music, and cooking. Please feel free to contact me via email.

Curretly, I'm looking forward a research opportunity.
