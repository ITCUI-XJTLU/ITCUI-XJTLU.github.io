Welcome to my personal website. Iâ€™m an incoming master student (thesis track) in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington in Seattle. Before I joined UW Biostatistics,  I graduated from the Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University with a BS degree in applied mathematics. 
My current research interests include:
Clinical trials
Survival Analysis
Statistical Learning
High dimensional Statistics

In my spare time, I enjoy competitive and recreational long distance running on Seattle's many trails, drinking tea and coffee, listening to music, and cooking. Please feel free to contact me via email.

Curretly, I'm looking forward a research opportunity.
